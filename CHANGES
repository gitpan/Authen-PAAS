   Changelog for Authen::PAAS
   ==========================

New in version 1.1.1:

 * Make sure all modules use 'warnings' and 'strict' pragmas
 * Replace use of 'confess' with plain 'die', since most calling
   programs will simply register a '$SIG{DIE}' hook to turn all
   'die' calls into 'confess' automatically.
 * Massive documentation improvements, 100% API coverage and 
   fixing of numerous errors
